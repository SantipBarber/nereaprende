# What is Health? 🌟

Health is like a superhero with three amazing powers! When we are healthy, we have:

## The Three Types of Health

### 1. Physical Health 💪
Good physical health means our body works well, just like a new toy:
- We can run and play without pain
- Our body is strong and energetic
- We can do activities easily
- *Example:* Like when you can play football during the whole break without getting tired!

### 2. Mental Health 😊
Good mental health means:
- We feel happy with ourselves
- We can control our emotions well
- We can solve problems calmly
- *Example:* Like when you can stay calm even if you lose a game

### 3. Social Health 👥
Good social health means:
- We have good relationships with others
- We get along with family and classmates
- We know how to make and keep friends
- *Example:* Like when you play well with your friends and share your toys

## Taking Care of Our Health 🌈

### Prevention
Being healthy is like being a health detective! We need to:

1. **Have Healthy Habits:**
- Eat fruits and vegetables (like a bunny!)
- Exercise regularly (like an Olympic athlete!)
- Sleep well (like a sleeping beauty!)
- *Example:* Eating an apple at break time instead of candy

2. **Visit the Doctor:**
- For regular check-ups
- It's like taking your bike to the mechanic, but for your body!
- Doctors help us stay healthy
- *Example:* Getting your height and weight checked

3. **Get Vaccinated:**
- Vaccines are like a shield against diseases
- They protect us from getting sick
- *Example:* Like putting on armor before a battle

> Remember: Prevention is better than cure! It's easier to stay healthy than to get better when we're sick.
